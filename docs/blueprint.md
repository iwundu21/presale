- Background color: Dark, desaturated purple (#2B2836) creates a sense of sophistication.
- Accent color: Light purple (#B08BFF) will add a highlight that pops without being overly bright.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern look.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for wallet connection and transaction history.
- Ensure a clean, professional layout with a clear information hierarchy.
- Subtle animations upon wallet connection and transaction confirmation.
